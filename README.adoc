This guide walks you through the process of creating a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]
and https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner] application
that optimizes a school timetable for students and teachers.

== What you'll build

You'll assign `Lesson` POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) to `Timeslot` and `Room` POJOs
to generate an optimal high school timetable which adheres to hard and soft scheduling constraints
by using OptaPlanner's constraint solving Artificial Intelligence on Spring Boot.

== What you'll need

== Make the application executable

Package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method:

`src/main/java/com/example/TimeTableSpringBootApp.java`
